I am working building a completely fleshed out Stellar Blade Opera GX theme that uses all of the available features. At this time, many of the features that are available to "Offical" mods are blocked by Opera GX and are only allowed for Verified Publishers. Features like Icons, Cursors, Font support, Splash Screens, App Icons, etc. I will release those features at a later date, however, those will only be able to be loaded through developer mode.
